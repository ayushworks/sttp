sttp: the Scala HTTP client you always wanted!
==============================================

Welcome!

`sttp client <https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp>`_ is an open-source library which provides a clean, programmer-friendly API to describe HTTP requests and execute them using one of the wrapped backends, such as `akka-http <https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/>`_, `async-http-client <https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client>`_, `http4s <https://http4s.org>`_ or `OkHttp <http://square.github.io/okhttp/>`_.

Here's a very quick example of sttp client in action::

  import sttp.client._

  val sort: Option[String] = None
  val query = "http language:scala"

  // the `query` parameter is automatically url-encoded
  // `sort` is removed, as the value is not defined
  val request = basicRequest.get(
    uri"https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=$query&sort=$sort")

  implicit val backend = HttpURLConnectionBackend()
  val response = request.send()

  // response.header(...): Option[String]
  println(response.header("Content-Length"))

  // response.unsafeBody: by default read into a String
  println(response.unsafeBody)
